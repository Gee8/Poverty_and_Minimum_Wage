# Poverty and Minimum Wage

## Topic
We will be analyizing multiple economic indicators, such as unemployment rate, minimum wage, median wage, Welfare spending by state and federal, Education spending by state and federal, and Home ownership to predict poverty level in the USA on both the state and national level.

## Reasons for Selection
Looking at the economic situation of the USA during and coming out of COVID, we are interested to see which economic factors most affect poverty levels.

## Data Sources
We are looking at data pulled from:
- SSA.gov
- census.gov
- BLS.gov (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
- Kaggle.com
- FRED.gov (Federal Reserve Bank)
- Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University
- taxpolicycenter.org
- usgovernmentspending.com

## Research Questions
Can poverty levels be extrapolated from historical economic indicators?
Which economic indicator has the highest impact on poverty levels?

## Communication Protocols
We have decided to use Slack as our main communication method. In the event of a technical issue or emergency, we have exchanged emails and phone numbers to stay connected. A Google Doc was created by Jose to outline our project and clarify the roles each team member will take on for each portion of the first segment deliverable.

## Technologies Used
We have decided to use the following technologies for our project:
- Pandas for data cleaning
- AWS RDS and Postgres for the database and data storage
